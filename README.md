### Create a dynamic table to visualize and filter UFO sighting data

In this project we utilized Java Script formulas, html formating and css styling to create a dynamic web application that displays UFO sighting data.  This page uses filters created with Java Script to select data and display in an HTML format.  The web application allows users to filter multiple criteria: such as date, city, state, country, and shape.

#### Performing a Search
Performing a search is as easy as entering any desired criteria. An unfiltered table is generated when opening the application.

Once the user updates the search criteria, it is filtered based on user input.  An example follows of filtering the database based on state.  The user inputs "nc" and extracts any sightings that are recorded in North Carolina.

Unfortunately, this page only responds to the most recent user input.  With the current coding it is unable to filter the data based on more than one criteria at a time.  I would reccomend adding code to filter muliple criteria at once.  I think it it would also be important to look at case sensitivity and popular abbreviations.
